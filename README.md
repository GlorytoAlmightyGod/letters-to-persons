# letters-to-persons
Here(raw_letter), i will be writing the actual text message i would like persons to know.
this(encrypted_letter) will be written by the encryptor_decryptor.c file using the raw_letter file as the input.
this letter(decrypted_encrypted_letter) will be generated using the encryptor_decryptor.c file taking encrypted_letter as the input.
decrypted_encrypted_letter is to be the exact replica of the raw_letter.

"GOD is the key!" <- this is what i will write in the code deciphiring section. every letter will have GOD in the end!

do a ./clean_up before staging any changes!

chmod +x run_me_please
chmod +x clean_up
./run_me_please
THAT's ALL!
NOTE: ALWAYS keep some empty lines at the bottom of the raw_letter file.
